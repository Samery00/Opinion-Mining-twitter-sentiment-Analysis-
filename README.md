# Opinion-Mining-twitter-sentiment-Analysis-
This proposed code is useful to analyse sentiments from twitter comments using Twitter API
Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral
requirements:
  Tweepy: tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API.
        use this command to install using pip : pip install tweepy
  TextBlob: textblob is the python library for processing textual data.
        use this : pip install textblob
  NLTK is installed when textblob installation is done
  
Now , we need to fetch tweets through Twitter API, one needs to register an App through their twitter account. Follow these steps to do so :
 - go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps  and click the button: ‘Create New App’
 - Fill the details.
 - Open the ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ tab.
 - And Copy ‘Consumer Key’, ‘Consumer Secret’, ‘Access token’ and ‘Access Token Secret’, then replace in the code.
